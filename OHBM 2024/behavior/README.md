This code was used for the behavior/cognition portion of the project. The files should be run in the following order:

1. 'behavioral_filtering.py' - sorts, cleans and prepares tabulated data for use.
2. 'behavioral_site_regression.py' - regresses site confounds from behavior data and performs PCA. Uses 'utils.py' for PCA.
