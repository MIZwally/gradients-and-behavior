This repository contains code used in the various posters and papers relating to my project with DSST on the relationship between cortical gradients and behavior/cognition in children.

See various folders for code relating to each submission. Each submission directory has a 'gradients' and a 'behavior' code directory for the two sides of the CCA.

The gradients folder contains files related to the gradient portion of analyis, which includes gradient creation and individual to group Spearman correlations, while the behavior folder holds the files that prepared the behavior and cognition side of the CCA.
