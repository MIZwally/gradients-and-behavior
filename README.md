# gradients-and-behavior
Authors: Mia Zwally, Dustin Moraczewski, Ka Chun Lam, and Adam Thomas.

This repository contains code used in the various posters and papers relating to my project with DSST on the relationship between cortical gradients and behavior/cognition in children.

See various folders for code relating to each submission. Each submission directory has a 'gradients' and a 'behavior' code directory, as well as a 'CCA' package directory.

The gradients folder contains files related to the gradient portion of analyis, which includes gradient creation and individual to group Spearman correlations, while the behavior folder holds the files that prepared the behavior and cognition side of the CCA.

The CCA folder contains files from a separate repository that were used as a package in the main code files. The code was written by one of the co-authors, Ka Chun Lam.
