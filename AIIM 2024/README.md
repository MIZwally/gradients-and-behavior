This folder contains the code used to complete the project that was presented at the ABCD Insights & Innovations Meeting in March 2024.

See the 'gradients' folder for Aim 1 and preparing individual-to-group correlations for CCA, and see 'behavior' for preparing behavior/cognition data for CCA.
'CCA_and_permutations.py' computes the CCA and runs the permutation test on the outputs generated from the 'gradients' and 'behavior' folders. 'permcca.py' and 'utils.py' are contain methods for CCA and permutation test computations.
