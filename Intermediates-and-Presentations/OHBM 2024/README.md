This folder contains the code used to complete the poster that was presented at the Organization for Human Brain Mapping annual meeting in June 2024.

See the 'gradients' folder for Aim 1 and preparing individual-to-group correlations for CCA, and see 'behavior' for preparing behavior/cognition data for CCA. 'CCA_and_permutations.py' computes the CCA and runs the permutation test on the outputs generated from the 'gradients' and 'behavior' folders. 'permcca.py' and 'utils.py' are contain methods for CCA and permutation test computations. The 'post-hoc' folder contains some of the code used in post-hoc analysis.
